# Sequence
A Python CLI rapid typing game built in curses.

# Aim
Type as much and as accurately as possible while avoiding penalty blocks. 

# Description
Presents a list of words that cycle upward. Words cycle immediately when typed correctly. Points are given for accurately typing words and letters, removed for incorrectly typed letters. Red blocks designate large penalties for typing on them. The Space key is used to skip words that are penalty-stricken. 

# Context
Made originally in another program for the sake of trying to get past my typing plateau of 100wpm, as well as for learning Python and Curses.
